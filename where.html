            <h1 class="whyList"> Do Your Homework </h1>
            <p class="myPara">Regardless of the type of fishing you enjoy, knowing how to find a good fishing spot is key. And the best way to locate the perfect place is by doing some research in advance. Start by going online and check out fishing forums in the area, local fishing associations, city and town tourism guides, or other resources on fishing hot spots. Once you identify some ideal fishing spots, be sure to follow local regulations in effect, for example, for licenses, permits, catch rates, and more.</p>
            
            <h1 class="whyList">Ask Locals</h1>
            <p class="myPara">No matter what you read online about how to find fishing spots, it is always helpful to get some personal input from seasoned area anglers. First, make sure you know what type of fish you want to catch. Then stop by the local bait shop and ask the workers for their favorite fishing spots for the species. You can also call up a fishing guide and see if they will share their knowledge on how to find a good fishing spot. Or simply stop by a location you are considering fishing and see if people are catching successfully.</p>

            <h1 class="whyList">Leverage Tools</h1>
            <p class="myPara">When it comes to finding your favorite fishing spots, a little knowledge can go a long way. And one option for knowing how to find fish is to use a special tool called a fishfinder. This technology allows you to use sonar to find fish in the area – with varying levels of detail – and their depth. Depending on the capability of the fishfinder, you may also be able to download maps, save logs, and access other features.</p>
            
            <h1 class="whyList">Tips and Tricks</h1>
            <p class="myPara">Fish like to hang around the shade. Just like us, they like to keep cool. Smaller fish also like to hang around fallen trees and coves where the water stream isn't as strong. They also do that to hide from bigger fish. Because bigger fish like eating smaller fish, these are also the areas where bigger fish like to lurk as well. So, the next time you go fishing, look for fallen debris, coves, and shady places. Just be careful of getting your lure stuck.</p>
